        <h1>WSDL Cataloging Service</h1>
        <p>This service implements the Catalog Content Protocol of the
        ebXML Registry Services and Protocols 3.0 standard.</p>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>The service input is a CatalogContentRequest, where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The OriginalContent is the ExtrinsicObject representing the
            WSDL to be cataloged.</li>
            <li>Any InvocationControlFile is ignored.</li>
            <li>Attachments are treated as RepositoryItems where the attachment's
            <code>content-id</code> is the id of the corresponding 
            ExtrinsicObject provided as the OriginalContent.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <p>The WSDL that is the RepositoryItem corresponding to the
        OriginalContent contains information about the services described by the WSDL.</p>
        
        <p>Information about the services is extracted from the RepositoryItem and
        registry objects corresponding to the service and its bindings are created.</p>
 
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>The output is a CatalogContentResponse.</p>
        <p>The CatalogContentResponse contains the RegistryObjectList that
        contains the OriginalContent augmented with objects
	representing the service and its bindings.</p>
