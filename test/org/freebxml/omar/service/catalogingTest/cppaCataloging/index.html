        <h1>Test CPPA Cataloging Service</h1>
        <p>This service implements the Catalog Content Protocol of the
        ebXML Registry Services and Protocols 3.0 standard.</p>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>The service input is a CatalogContentRequest, where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The OriginalContent is the ExtrinsicObject representing the
            CPPA document to be cataloged.</li>
            <li>The InvocationControlFile is the ExtrinsicObject
            representing an XSLT stylesheet that does the cataloging.</li>
            <li>Attachments are treated as RepositoryItems where the attachment's
            <code>content-id</code> is the id of the corresponding 
            ExtrinsicObject provided as the OriginalContent or
            InvocationControlFile.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <p>The input document for the XSLT transformation is the
        OriginalContent.</p>
        <p>The Id of the OriginalContent is provided to the XSLT stylesheet as
        the value of the <code>repositoryItem</code> parameter.</p>
        <p>The service includes a URIResolver that first attempts to resolve
        URIs in XSLT <code>document()</code> function calls to a RepositoryItem
        corresponding to an
        ExtrinsicObject provided in the input.</p>
        <p>The transformation result should be a RegistryObjectList.</p>
 
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>The output is a CatalogContentResponse.</p>
        <p>The CatalogContentResponse contains the RegistryObjectList that was
        the output of the transformation.</p>
        <p>The original attachments to the CatalogContentRequest are copied as
        attachments to the CatalogContentResponse just so this service can
        be used to test processing of attachements to CatalogContentResponse
        messages.</p>
