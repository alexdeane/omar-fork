<h2>Registry Browser - Web UI Browser User Guide</h2>
<p align="center"><font size="4">(Early Draft v0.1)</font></p>

<h2><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes how to use the Web UI Registry Browser to
query and drill down into Registry and Repository content. The
Registry Browser Web UI currently provides read-only access to
content. A future release will have a publish feature.</p>
<p>The Registry Browser Web UI is based on Java Server Faces 1.1_01
and designed to work with standard web browsers such as Mozilla,
Netscape and Internet Explorer. It requires that JavaScript be
supported and enabled in the browser. </p>

<h2><a name="getting_started"></a>2. Getting Started</h2>
<p>This section describes what you need to do to get started using
the Registry Browser Web UI browser.</p>
<p>First, the Registry must be installed, configured and started.
See the <a href="http://ebxmlrr.sourceforge.net/3.0/SetupGuide.html">
SetupGuide.html</a> for details. After that, no user configuration is required.</p>
<p>Next, start a web browser. If the Registry is installed on a
local machine using default configuration, enter the following URL in
your browser:</p>
<p><code>http://localhost:8080/omar/registry/thin/WelcomePage.jsp</code></p>
<p>The URL shown above is the default. 'localhost' should resolve to
your local machine name, '8080' is the default port, and
'omar/registry/thin/browser.jsp' is the default URI. If the
Registry is not deployed locally, or not deployed using default
properties, obtain the URL from the Registry Administrator.</p>
<p>After that, the Registry Browser Web UI should appear in your web
browser. The following sections provide more information on layout, discovery,
search results and drill down features.</p>

<h2><a name="overall_layout"></a>3. Overall Layout</h2>
<p>The Registry Browser Web UI is organized as follows - it has one
main frame that contains a frameset of four additional frames:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Banner Frame - this is the top,
horizontal frame with a logo, title and tool bar. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Discovery Frame - this is left side
frame with links to Explore Registry and Search Registry. As the
title suggests, this frame is used to discover what content is in the
Registry and Repository. The content is made up of Registry Informaton
Model (RIM) metadata objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Search Results Frame - this is the
right upper frame that contains the results of a query or explore task.
It contains a tabular display of RIM object search results. A
subset of the RIM object's attributes is displayed as columns, and each
result is displayed as rows. A drill-down can be done on each
search result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detail Frame - this is the right lower frame that contains the
results of the drill-down. The result contains all the RIM
object's attributes and composed objects displayed in one file
tab. Other RIM objects, related to the drill down object, are
also displayed in separate, sequential file folders.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>See sections below for more details.</p>

<h2><a name="discovering_content"></a>4. Discovering Content</h2>
<p><a name="explore_registry"></a><a name="search_registry"></a>There
are two ways to discover Registry content: exploring content using
file folders and querying content using query forms. Each is
discussed in subsections below:</p>
<h3>4.1 Explore Registry</h3>
<p>In the Discovery page, click on the Explore
Registry link. The Explore Registry page will load in the
Discovery frame. This page allows you to navigate through Registry
and Repository content using a hierarchy of file folders. The
root folder, named 'registry', contains all Registry content, and is
similar to the UNIX root directory. </p>
<p>Click on the expansion image directly left of the folder to expand the
'registry' folder. You should see a subfolder named 'userData'. This
is the default folder where all user content is placed.</p>
<p> To review the contents of a folder, click on the folder image or the
folder name. The search results will appear in the
SearchResultsFrame directly to the right. You may review
details of each item by clicking on the Details link located in the
first column of the search results table. See the <a
 href="#search_result_drill_downs">Search
Result Drill Downs</a> section below for details.</p>

<h3>4.2 Search Registry</h3>
<p>In the Discovery page, click on the
Search Registry link. The Search Registry page will load in the
Discovery frame. At the top of the page is a drop-down list,
called 'Select ad-hoc query', that contains a list of preconfigured
queries. Clicking a member of this list, causes a new query
form to be loaded in the Search Registry page. Business Query
query is the default query in the list, and will be used in the
following description.</p>

<h3>4.2.1 Business Query Form</h3>
<p>This form enables querying based on the RIM type,
name, description and one or more classifications. It is
equivalent to the Business Query contained in the Thick Client.
This query is good for general querying - more specific queries can
be configured for specific target audiences.</p>
<p>The default ObjectType is 'RegistryObject' which is the parent type of
all RIM objects. Not surprisingly, executing a query with this type
will return a large result set. For smaller result sets, choose
a different type such as 'Service' or 'Organization'. Then,
click the Search button. The search results will appear in the
SearchResultsFrame in the upper right. This kind of query is
not filtered in any way - all objects are returned. See below
for how to filter the result set.</p>
<p>The Name, Description and
Classifications are all used to filter the search results. For
example, select 'Service' from the ObjectType list box, enter
'%ebXML%' into the Name field, and click the Search button.
You should see one search result: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
      <p>Details</p>
      </th>
      <th>
      <p>ObjectType</p>
      </th>
      <th>
      <p>Name</p>
      </th>
      <th>
      <p>Description</p>
      </th>
      <th>
      <p>Version</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p><u>Details</u></p>
      </td>
      <td>
      <p>Service</p>
      </td>
      <td>
      <p>ebXML Registry Service</p>
      </td>
      <td>
      <p>Sun's OASIS ebXML Registry V3.0 service</p>
      </td>
      <td>
      <p>
      </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><a name="displaying_search_results"></a>
<a name="search_result_drill_downs"></a></p>
<p>The '%' is used as the wildcard character. </p>

<h3>4.2.2 Displaying Search Results</h3>
<p>The search results from a
query are displayed in the SearchResultsFrame in the upper right.
They are displayed in a tabular format - RIM object attributes are
displayed as table columns, each RIM object is displayed as table
rows.</p>
<p>The columns displayed to the user can be configured for
each RIM object. For example, Service objects can display five
attributes, Extrinsic Objects display four attributes and so on.
See the Registry Browser Web UI Configuration Guide for details.</p>
<p>If there are more rows in the result set than the Registry Browser Web
UI can display, the scroller at the bottom of the Search Results page
can be used to navigate forward and backward through the set.</p>
<p>Each row in the search results contains a Details column with a link to
the Details page. Click on any of the links to see an object's
details.</p>

<h3>4.2.2 Search Result Drill Downs</h3>
<p>The search result table contains links to a Details page for any RIM
object. Execute a query as explained previously. Click on
the Details link. The Details page displays in the DetailFrame
in the lower right. Scroll down the page to see all the
object's attributes and composed objects. Other objects,
related to the drill down object, are also displayed in adjacent tab
folders. Click on any of these other tabs to see details on
these related objects.</p>

<h2><a name="creating_relationships"></a>5. Creating Relationships</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of relationships: references and
associations. A reference is a unidirectional relationship from
source to target object. An assocation is a bidirectional
relationship that contains additional metadata such as what kind of an
assocation it is.</p>
<p>References are only supported between some pairs of object types.
For example, a Service source object can have a reference to a
ServiceBinding object. Assocations can be created between any two
object types. If a reference is valid, the Reference option will
be shown first. Users still have the option of creating an
Asssocation. Click the radio button in the Relationship table to
toggle between Reference and Association types.</p>

<h3>5.1 Creating References</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Select the source object.</li>
  <li>Click the Reference radio button, if it is not already clicked.
The valid reference attribute should display.</li>
  <li>Click the Save button to save the reference.</li>
</ol>

<h3>5.2 Creating Associations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Select the source object.</li>
  <li>Click the Assocation radio button, if it is not already
clicked. The Assocation.jsp page should appear.</li>
  <li>Fill out the Assocation.jsp form.</li>
  <li>Click the Save button to save the association.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="publish"></a>6. Publishing</h2>
<p>Before you can publish, you must first register. See the <a
 href="../UserRegistrationGuide.html">User Registration Guide</a> for
more details.</p>
<p><span id="publishView:addNewRO:addNewROSteps">To create a new
registry object, perform these steps:</span>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click Create a New Registry Object in the left sidebar. The
Create a New Registry Object page should appear in the left sidebar.</li>
  <li><span id="publishView:addNewRO:addNewROStepsView:addNewROSteps1">Choose
an object type from the drop-down list and click Add.</span></li>
  <li><span id="publishView:addNewRO:addNewROStepsView:addNewROSteps2">Type
entries in the fields of the Details form.</span></li>
  <li><span id="publishView:addNewRO:addNewROStepsView:addNewROSteps2">Optionally,
click on the object's tab folders, such as Slot, and add composed
objects.</span></li>
  <li><span id="publishView:addNewRO:addNewROStepsView:addNewROSteps3">Click
Save.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="pinning_objects"></a>7. Pinning Objects</h2>
<p>In order to create an Assocation, you must select two Registry
objects. Usually, these are objects with different object types.
One way to get a result set with two different object types, is to
'pin' the first object in the result set so that it appears in the
second result set. This enables you to do a first query for one
object type, such as Organization, pin the Organization object, and
then do a second query for a different object type, such as
Service. You can then select both these objects and create an
Assocation between them.</p>
<p><span id="publishView:addNewRO:addNewROSteps">To pin a
registry object, perform these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the Search Form in the left sidebar to create a first set of
objects</li>
  <li>Click the checkbox in the Pin column in the far right of the row</li>
  <li>Click Clear in the Search Form. The pinned object is still
visible, and the nonpinned objects are cleared.</li>
  <li>Use the Search Form to create a second set of new objects. You
can now click the Pick checkboxes of both objects, and proceed to
create an Association between them by clicking Relate in the toolbar.</li>
</ol>
<p>To remove the pin, click the Pin checkbox a second time, and click
Clear. The pinned object should now no longer be visible.</p>
