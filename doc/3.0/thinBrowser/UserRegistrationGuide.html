<p>You can browse the public content of a registry. However, both
access to private objects and write access to public objects require
that you are logged in and are authorized to perform that action on
that object. Please see the <a href="../UserRegistrationGuide.html">User
Registration Guide</a> for an overview.</p>
<p>You must register with a registry before you can log-on to that
registry and perform secure operations such as object publishing,
update and removal. After registration, you will load your client
certificate into your web browser. This allows the Registry to
identify and authenticate you.</p>
<p>Registration using Registry Browser Web UI involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#createUserAccount">Creating a User Account</a></li>
  <li><a href="#loadCredentials">Loading Client Certificate into the Web Browser</a></li>
  <li><a href="#loadCredentialsToJAXR">Loading Client Certificate to JAXR provider (optional)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>After that you are able to <a href="#login">authenticate</a> with the registry.</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2><a name="createUserAccount">1. Creating a User Account</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Browse to Registry Browser Web UI welcome page</li>
  <li>Click the 'Create User Account' on the left side menu</li>
  <li>Click the 'Start Registration Wizard' button</li>
  <li>Step 1: Read the requirements and click 'Next' button</li>
  <li>Step 2: Fill in the user details. Notice that first and last name are
required. Click 'Next' button to continue.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Fill in the user authentication details. Unless you already have a
CA certified digital private key, you should choose 'Generate Key pair and
download PKCS12 KeyStore'. <b>Important</b>: remember the password you write here.
It will be needed to import the certificate on a later step. Click 'Next' button
to continue.</li>
  <li>Step 4: click the 'Download' link and save the certificate file in your
computer.</li>
  <li>Click 'Finish' button to end the Registration Wizard.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="loadCredentials">2. Loading Client Certificate into Web Browser</a></h2>
<p>The Web UI requires client certificates to authenticate users.
You may still browse Registry content without authenticating, but you
cannot publish, and you cannot see restricted content. Please see the <a
 href="../UserRegistrationGuide.html#loadCredentials">User
Registration Guide</a> for how load the certificate into your web
browser.</p>

<h2><a name="loadCredentials">3. Loading Client Certificate into Web Browser</a></h2>
<p>The Web UI requires client certificates to authenticate users.
You may still browse Registry content without authenticating, but you
cannot publish, and you cannot see restricted content. Please see the <a

<h2><a name="login">4. User Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Authentication is based on client certificates. These certificates
are loaded into your web browser and presented to the Registry over a
secure connection. Usually, https is used for this connection.
Authentication happens transparently whenever you try to add, delete
or modify an existing Registry object. In other words, any write
request will trigger authentication based on the client certificate
loaded into your web browser.</p>
<p>The following are some additional points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After authentication is completed, you will be accessing the
Registry over https. You may go back to http if you wish.</li>
  <li>You may browse or querying the Registry over http. However,
you may not be able to see all registry content.</li>
  <li>When your session expires, you are no longer authenticated by the
Registry. A subsequent write request will prompt the Web UI to
reauthenticate you.</li>
</ul>
