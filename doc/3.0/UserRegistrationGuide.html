<h2><a name=" Tutorial - User Registration">User Registration Guide</a></h2>
<p>You can browse the public content of a registry. However, both
access to private objects and write access to public objects require
that you are logged in and are authorized to perform that action on
that object.</p>
<p>You must register with a registry before you can log-on to that
registry and perform secure operations such as object publishing,
update and removal. Registration involves two main steps:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#createUserAccount">Creating a User Account</a></li>
  <li><a href="#loadCredentials">Loading User Credentials into the Web
Browser</a></li>
  <li><a href="#loadCredentialsToJAXR">Loading Client Certificate to JAXR provider (optional)</a></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2><a name="createUserAccount">1. Creating a User Account</a></h2>
<p>There are 2 possible ways to create an user account in the registry:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="registryBrowser/userreg.html#createUserAccount">User Registration Using
 Registry Browser Java UI</a></li>
  <li><a href="thinBrowser/UserRegistrationGuide.html">User Registration Using
 Registry Browser Web UI</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: The credentials generated by Registry Browser Java UI will not be
accepted for autentication when using the Web UI. This is because these credentials
have not been signed by the RegistryOperator. We recommend that you use the
<a href="../thinBrowser/UserRegistrationGuide.html">Web UI</a> user registration
so that you'll have valid credentials for both web browser and JAXR provider.</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2><a name="loadCredentials">2. Loading User Credentials into Web Browser</a></h2>
<p>The Registry authenticates Web UI clients using client certificates. The
Registry receives your certificate via your web browser. In order for this to
happen, you must load the certificate into your browser. Please complete the
steps according to your web browser type.</p>

<div class="h3">
<h3><a name="loadCertMozilla">Mozilla/FireFox</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click menu options Edit -&gt; Preferences.</li>
  <li>Click Advanced category in sidebar to expand options.</li>
  <li>Click Security tab.</li>
  <li>Click View Certificates button.</li>
  <li>The Your Certificates tab should appear. Click the Import button.</li>
  <li>Use the File Name to Restore file dialog to select your .p12
certificate file. Note: this file is either provided by a third-party
Certificatge Authority, or it is generated by the Registry as part of
the registration process. Click this file and click the Open button.</li>
  <li>In the Prompt Dialog, enter an account password for the
'master password for the Software Security Device'. Note: this password
is browser account specific and
assigned by browser profile owner. A good convention is to use same
password as the login account on the client machine. </li>
  <li>In the Password Entry Dialog, enter the certificate password.
This password is used to protect the client certificate.<br>
Note: if you decided to have the Registry create a self-signed
certificate for you, it is the same password you used in the
Registration Wizard.</li>
  <li>You should see an Alert dialog with the message: 'Successfully
restored your security certificate(s) and private key(s). Click the OK
button.</li>
  <li>Close the Certificate Manager and Preferences dialogs.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3><a name="loadCertNetscape">Netscape</a></h3>
<p>(Not documented yet; please report the steps to the <a 
href="mailto:ebxmlrr@lists.sourceforge.net">user's list</a>).</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3><a name="loadCertOpera">Opera</a></h3>
<ol>
 <li>Open the preferences window from the Tools - Preferences menu, or by pressing CTRL+F12.</li>
 <li>In the Advanced tab, choose Security from the left panel.</li>
 <li>Click the Manage Certificates button. The Certificate Manager window should pop up.</li>
 <li>In the Personal tab, click the Import button. Select your .p12 file.</li>
 <li>Enter the certificate password.
This password is used to protect the client certificate.<br>
Note: if you decided to have the Registry create a self-signed
certificate for you, it is the same password you used in the
Registration Wizard.</li>
 <li>Now enter your password for the Opera Certificate Store. If it does not yet exist, you will be asked to give and confirm the password</li>
 <li>You should now see your certificate in the certificate list. Close the Certificate Manager and Preferences Window.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3><a name="loadCertIE">Internet Explorer</a></h3>
<ol>
 <li>In Windows Explorer, double click your .p12 file. The Certificate Import Wizard should pop up. Click next twice.</li>
 <li>Enter the certificate password.
This password is used to protect the client certificate.<br>
Note: if you decided to have the Registry create a self-signed
certificate for you, it is the same password you used in the
Registration Wizard.<br>At your choice, enable or disable strong private key protection or the exportable private key option.</li>
 <li>In the next window, let the wizard automatically select the certificate store. Click next and finish the wizard</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3><a name="loadCertMacX">Mac OS X</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li>After you downloaded the certificate, start the application "Keychain Access" (under Applications/Utilities)</li>
  <li>Go to File -> Import</li>
  <li>Import the certificate file that you just downloaded. During import you will be asked for the password that you chose in step 3 of the registration wizard.</li>
  <li>That's it, from now on the web browser should automatically authenticate you.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2> <a name="loadCredentialsToJAXR">Loading Client Certificate to JAXR provider</a></h2>
<p>This step makes your newly registered certificate (and its private key) available
to the JAXR provider for use with the Registry Browser Java UI and other JAXR
applications. See Registry Browser Java UI <a href="registryBrowser/userreg.html#loadCredentialsToJAXR">
load credentials to JAXR</a> for more details.</p>

<h2><a name="login">User Authentication</a></h2>
<p>See the following documents for how user authentication happens:</p>
