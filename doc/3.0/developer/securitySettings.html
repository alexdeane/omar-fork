<h2>Web UI - Configuring an Anonymous User Principal Name<br>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br>
<br>
In order to submit content to the Registry, a Registry Client must have
the proper credentials. One kind of proper credential is a client
certficate. When submitting content using the Web UI, the client
certificate may be imported into your web browser and sent to the web
container over a secure connection. The certificate is used by the Web
UI to identify and authenticate the Client. See the <a
 href="../UsingHTTPS.html">Using HTTPS</a> document for details. This
is the recommended configuration for production deployments.<br>
</p>
<p>For developer deployments, however, there is another Web UI option
that does involve less configuration.&nbsp; You can set a property to
indicate which user principal name to use for authentication.&nbsp; The
user principal name maps to the alias of the client certificate. So,
instead of each user sending their client certificate over a secure
connection, the Registry will load a client certificate from the client
keystore file using the principal name.&nbsp; The client keystore is
located in this file:<br>
</p>
<pre>${user.home}/${omar.name}/${dist.version}/jaxr-ebxml/security/keystore.jks</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The omar.name and dist.version properties are set in
omar/build.properties.<br>
<br>
Note: this option is only available for Web UI deployments that do not
have container-managed authentication. This kind of authentication
involves the web container protecting the Web UI's resources such as
its JSP pages. The container manages the authentication, and, as a
result, handles the setting of the Client's principal name.&nbsp; Since
the container sets the principal name, configuring an anonymous one is
not an option.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting Started</span><br>
</p>
<p>To enable this option, do the following:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a user account and its associated credentials (client
certificate)<br>
The client certificate will be loaded by the Web UI during
authentication.&nbsp; The easiest approach is to run the
'createTestUser' target contained in omar/build-dist.xml.&nbsp; The
principal name (certificate alias) is set to 'testuser'.&nbsp; See the
build.xml for how this is set via the ${testUserAlias} property.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Set the following property to the certificate's alias in
omar-common.properties:<br>
    <pre>omar.security.anonymousUserPrincipalName=&lt;certificate alias&gt;</pre>
In the above example, &lt;certificate alias&gt; is replaced by
'testuser'.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Run the 'ant deploy' target.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Restart your web container.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>When you publish content to the Registry, the Web UI will use the
above property to load the client certificate from the client keystore.
It will then set the Current User: &lt;certificate alias&gt; in the Web
UI's banner page, replacing the default 'Current User: Registry Guest'
setting for unauthenticated users. The change of the Current User is a
visual way to determine that this kind of authentication was successful.<br>
