<h2>Admin Tool Guide</h2>
<p>The admin tool utility provides a simple, command-line interface
for common administration tasks such as adding Associations to the
registry and removing objects from the registry</p>

<p><em>The admin tool is still actively being developed.  This means
that there may be differences between the current version and what has
been documented here.  It also means that it is still possible for you
to lobby for any features that you want to see added to the admin
tool.  Lastly, it means that the admin tool needs you to test it out
to make sure that it works as expected.</em></p>

<p>The tool operates either in batch mode, where it executes the
commands specified on the command line, or in interactive mode, where
you enter your sequence of commands in the tool's interactive
shell.</p>

<p>In keeping with the "files and folders" metaphor used for
RegistryObjects in RegistryPackages, several commands - such as
<tt>ls</tt> and <tt>rm</tt> - mimic both the name and the
behavior of well-known Unix commands that operate on files and
folders.  There are also other, registry-specific commands that have
no corresponding Unix equivalent.</p>

<p>For information on configuring and extending the admin tool, see
the <a href="developer/adminTool.html">admin tool developer
guide</a>.</p>

<div>
<h2>Running the Admin Tool</h2>

<p>You run the admin tool by executing the <tt>admin-tool.jar</tt> jar
file:</p>

<pre>java -jar path/to/admin-tool.jar &lt;parameters></pre>

<div>
<h3>Batch mode</h3>

<p>For example, to execute a command on the command line:</p>

<pre>java -jar build/lib/admin-tool.jar -command "ls *.html"</pre>

<p>The admin tool will echo your commands and the tool's responses to
the screen and then exit once your commands have been executed.</p>

<p>It's up to you to make sure that you properly escape any characters
that are significant to your shell.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Ant target</h3>

<p>This is batch mode under another name, since the Ant target just
runs the admin tool with arguments that you specified in the
<tt>-DadminTool.args</tt> argument to Ant, e.g.:</p>

<pre>ant -DadminTool.args="-command \"ls *.html\"" run.adminTool</pre>

<p>It is up to you to adequately escape any characters that are
significant either to your shell or to Ant.  For example, any '\'
characters may need to be escaped one or more times.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Interactive mode</h3>

<p>To start the admin tool shell where the same command can be
entered interactively:</p>

<pre>java -jar build/lib/admin-tool.jar</pre>

<p>The admin tool will emit an <tt>admin></tt> prompt and wait for
your input.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div>
<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>The following parameters are recognised when starting the admin
tool:</p>

<pre>[-alias &lt;alias>]
[-class &lt;adminShellClass>]
[-command &lt;commands>]
[-debug]
[-help]
[-keypass &lt;keypass>]
[-localdir &lt;localdir>]
[-locale &lt;locale>]
[-property &lt;name> &lt;value>]*
[-registry &lt;url>]
[-root &lt;locator> [-create]]
[-sqlselect &lt;SQL statement>]
[-v | -verbose]
</pre>
<p>Where:

<dl>

<dt><tt>-alias &lt;alias></tt></dt>

<dd>Alias to use when accessing user's certificate in keystore.
Default alias defined in <tt>jaxr-ebxml.properties</tt> is used if
this is not specified.</dd>

<dt><tt>-basedir &lt;basedir></tt></dt>

<dd>Base directory in local file system for commands that relate to
files in the local file system.</dd>

<dt><tt>-class &lt;adminShellClass></tt></dt>

<dd>Class to use for instance of AdminShell.  The default class
generated by
<tt>org.freebxml.omar.client.adminTool.AdminShellFactory</tt> is used
if omitted.</dd>

<dt><tt>-command &lt;commands></tt></dt>

<dd>Admin tool command sequence to run instead of getting commands
from <tt>System.in</tt>.  Separate commands should be separated by
a semicolon (;).  It is not necessary to include a 'quit' command
in <tt>&lt;commands></tt>.  If you need a ';' that is not a command
separator, include it as '\;'.  (Note that the shell in which you
run the Admin tool may require the '\' in '\;' to be quoted by a
second '\').  <em>If any command contains spaces, the entire command
sequence must be enclosed in single or double quotes so the
sequence is treated as one command-line parameter instead of
several.</em>  If your shell also interprets ';' as separating shell
commands, you will always have to quote sequences of multiple admin
shell commands.</dd>

<dt><tt>-create</tt></dt>

<dd>If necessary, create the RegistryPackage specified by the
<tt>-root</tt> parameter as well as any parent RegistyPackage
objects as needed.</dd>

<dt><tt>-debug</tt></dt>

<dd>Output extra information that is useful when debugging.</dd>

<dt><tt>-keypass &lt;keypass></tt></dt>

<dd>Keypass to use when accessing user's certificate in keystore.
Default keypass defined in <tt>jaxr-ebxml.properties</tt> is used if
this is not specified.</dd>

<dt><tt>-locale &lt;locale></tt></dt>

<dd>Locale (e.g., "EN" or "FR_ca") to use for selecting the resource
bundle to use for error and status messages.  The default is
determined by the Java VM.</dd>

<dt><tt>-property &lt;name> &lt;value></tt></dt>

<dd>Name and value of an additional property that may be used by a
particular implementation of
<tt>org.freebxml.omar.client.adminTool.AdminShell</tt> or by a
particular implementation of
<tt>org.freebxml.omar.client.adminTool.AdminShellFunction</tt>.
Implementations will ignore any additional properties that they do not
support.</dd>

<dt><tt>-registry &lt;url></tt></dt>

<dd>URL of ebXML registry to which to connect.  The value of the
<tt>jaxr-ebxml.soap.url</tt> property, if specified in
<tt>jaxr-ebxml.properties</tt>, is used if omitted, otherwise a
built-in default is used.</dd>

<dt><tt>-root &lt;locator></tt></dt>

<dd>Locator (e.g., "<tt>/registry/userData</tt>") of the
RegistryPackage to use as the base for those commands that treat
the repository as a tree of RegistryPackage objects that each
contain other RegistryObject and RegistryPackage objects.  The
default is the RegistryPackage that is defined for user's data:
<tt>/registry/userData</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>-sqlselect &lt;SQL statement></tt></dt>

<dd>Execute &lt;SQL statement> to select registry objects.  This
should be a complete SQL statement, i.e., it should start with
'select'.  The SQL statement does not have to be terminated by a
semicolon (;).</dd>

<dt><tt>-v</tt> or <tt>-verbose</tt></dt>

<dd>Specifies verbose output of status messages.</dd>

</dl>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Using the Admin Tool</h2>

<div>
<h3>Exception Reporting</h3>

<p>The admin tool tries to save you from having to view long stack
traces whenever a command fails.</p>

<p>When a command fails, the admin shell prints the first line of the
stack trace and the following:</p>

<pre>An error occurred when executing the function.  Use 'show exception' to view messages.</pre>

<p>Note that if the classes used by the command are ill-behaved and
also write error messages to the screen, you'll see those as
well.</p>

<p>If you need more information, you can execute <tt>show exception</tt>
as the next command to see the full stack trace.</p>

<p>Since <tt>show exception</tt> always shows you the stack trace of
the immediately previous command, if you execute a different command
before you execute <tt>show exception</tt>, you'll get the stack trace
(or absence of stack trace) from that command.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Identifying Registry Objects</h3>

<p>The primary way to identify objects is by name.  This extends to
identifying RegistryPackage objects by the "path" from the registry
root to the RegistryPackage.  For example, <tt>/registry/userData</tt>
is the path to the <tt>userData</tt> RegistryPackage.</p>

<p>Some matches for names support the wildcards '?' for matching a
single character and '*' for matching zero or more characters.</p>

<p>Some commands - for example, <tt>cd</tt> and <tt>chown</tt>
- support identifying objects by their UUID, which must include
the leading "urn:uuid"; for example,
<tt>urn:uuid:2702f889-3ced-4d49-82d1-e4cd846cb9e4</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>chown</tt> command also supports using
<tt>%<i>number</i></tt> to refer to a User object's UUID as listed by
a preceding <tt>users</tt> command.</p>

<p>In some commands, you can enter names containing spaces either by
enclosing the whole name in double quotes (<tt>"</tt>) or by preceding
each space in the name by a backslash (<tt>\</tt>).</p>

<p><em>If you find all this confusing and inconsistent then, firstly,
come up with the unified theory for how to refer to objects and,
secondly, implement it or lobby to have it implemented.</em></p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Effect of Locale</h3>

<p>A RegistryObject (or a RegistryPackage) may have multiple names
that are each associated with a different locale.</p>

<p>The paths and object names that you specify are evaluated with
respect to the current locale only.  When you attempt to select by
name a registry object that has multiple names, the registry server
attempts to match the name that you provide against only one
alternative for the registry object's name - the choice whose
locale most closely matches the current locale - not against all
the multiple names for the registry object.</p>

<p>For example, consider the case when the current RegistryPackage has
a member object that has two names, each associated with a different
locale: "red" in the <tt>en</tt> (English) locale and "rouge" in the
<tt>fr</tt> (French) locale.  When the current locale is <tt>en</tt>,
the command <tt>ls rouge</tt> will not display that member object, but
when the locale is <tt>fr</tt> (or one of its variants), the same
command will display that member object.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Case Sensitivity</h3>

<p>Command names and literal parameters that are recognised by the
admin tool shell are <em>not</em> case sensitive.  For example,
<tt>ls</tt>, <tt>Ls</tt>, and <tt>LS</tt> are equivalent.</p>

<p>Parameters where you provide the value are passed verbatim to the
code that uses the parameter.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div>
<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>The following sections explain the available commands.  Each
section begins with the command's usage pattern.  Within the usage
patterns:</p>

<ul>

<li><tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>></tt> indicate a parameter that should be
replaced by a real value when you run the command</li>

<li><tt>(</tt> and <tt>)</tt> delimit a choice of parameters (with
parameters separated by <tt>|</tt>) where you must include one of the
parameters</li>

<li><tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> delimit a parameter or choice of
parameters that may be omitted</li>

<li><tt>+</tt> after a parameter indicates that you may repeat the
parameter</li>

<li>Anything else is literal text that you must include when running
the command</li>

</ul>

<p>The following "datatypes" are used as parameter values:</p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>&lt;string></tt></dt>

<dd>A sequence of characters.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;file></tt></dt>

<dd>A filename.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;uuid></tt></dt>

<dd>A UUID starting with <tt>urn:uuid:</tt>, for example,
<tt>urn:uuid:4a6741e7-4be1-4cfb-960a-e5520356c4fd</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;%uuid></tt></dt>

<dd>A '<tt>%</tt> followed by decimal digits, e.g. <tt>%1</tt> or
<tt>%12</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;locator></tt></dt>

<dd>The "path" of names of RegistryObject from the "root" of the
repository to an object in the repository, with each name preceded by
'<tt>/</tt>'.  For example, the locator for the <tt>userData</tt>
RegistryPackage that is a member of the <tt>registry</tt>
RegistryPackage (which is not itself a member of any RegistryPackage)
is <tt>/registry/userData</tt>, and the locator of the
<tt>folder1</tt> RegistryPackage that is a member of the
<tt>userData</tt> package is <tt>/registry/userData/folder1</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;command></tt></dt>

<dd>An admin tool command name, for example, <tt>echo</tt> or
<tt>chown</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;pattern></tt></dt>

<dd>A pattern comprising literal characters and the special characters
'<tt>*</tt>' (representing zero or more characters) and '<tt>?</tt>'
(representing one and only one character).</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;property></tt></dt>

<dd>Name of a property whose value can be set with the <tt>set</tt>
command or shown with the <tt>show</tt> command.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;value></tt></dt>

<dd>An allowed value for the property being set.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;SQL></tt></dt>

<dd>An SQL select statement (without the leading <tt>select</tt> since
that is already present as the name of the command).</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;objectType></tt></dt>

<dd>Name of an object type, for example, <tt>association</tt> or
<tt>user</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;properties></tt></dt>

<dd>One or more properties of an object type.</dd>

</dl>

<div>
<h3><tt>add association</tt></h3>

<pre>add association -type &lt;type> &lt;sourceUUID> &lt;targetUUID></pre>

<p>Adds an Association object of the specified type, e.g.,
<tt>HasMember</tt>, between the source and target objects.</p>

         [-email3.address &lt;string>]</pre>

<p>Adds a User object.  The information that you provide is checked
for validity using the same criteria as used when adding a new user
using the Swing client.</p>

<p>You can specify the information about the user either on the
command line itself or by using the <tt>-load</tt> parameter to
specify a Java properties file with the information.  The information
parameters and the <tt>-load</tt> parameter are evaluated in the order
they appear on the command line; so, for example, you can specify some
properties on the command line, load others from a properties file,
and then override information in the properties file with later
command-line parameters.</p>

<p>You must specify at least one address, telephone number, and email
address for the new user, and you can specify up to three of each
type.  If you need more, then you can add them later using one of the
GUI clients.</p>

<p>When you specify a address, telephone number, or email address, you
must provide a value for its type, e.g., <tt>-emailType work</tt>.</p>

<p>You can use shorthand parameters on the command line for some of
the common information that is required for every user, but you must
use the longer form when providing the information in a properties
file.  For example, you can specify the user's first email address on
the command line using one of <tt>-email1.address</tt>,
<tt>-emailAddress</tt>, or <tt>-email</tt>, but when you specify it in
a properties file, you must use <tt>email1.address=</tt>.  Since there
is only one choice for the user's second email address, you must use
<tt>-email2.address</tt> on the command line and
<tt>email2.address=</tt> in a properties file.</p>

<p>When you use <tt>-edit</tt>, the admin tool launches an editor so
you can edit the new user's information.  The tool launches the editor
<em>after</em> evaluating the other command-line parameters, so
editing starts with the result of evaluating any information specified
on the command line or with a <tt>-load</tt> properties file.  The
editing program must terminate without error before the command can
continue.  <em>(At the time of this writing, <tt>-edit</tt> currently
works with <tt>emacsclient</tt> and
<tt>/path/to/NetBeans/bin/runide.sh --open</tt> (but not very well),
has not been shown to work with <tt>vi</tt>, and has not been tested
on Windows.)</em></p>

<p>The properties files that you load with <tt>-load</tt> or edit with
<tt>-edit</tt> use the IS0-8859-1 charset, as do all Java properties
files.  See the documentation for <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)"><tt>java.util.Properties.load(InputStream)</tt></a>
for details on how to represent other characters not in ISO-8859-1 in
properties files.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>cd</tt></h3>

<pre>cd &lt;locator> | &lt;uuid></pre>

<p>Change "directory" to the RegistryPackage at the specified path or
with the specified UUID.</p>

<p>Changing to a specified UUID is useful when there are multiple
RegistryPackage objects with the same path (for the current
locale).</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>chown</tt></h3>

<pre>chown (&lt;uuid> | &lt;%index>)</pre>

<p>Change the ownership of the objects selected with a preceding
<tt>select</tt> command to the user specified by either the UUID or
the reference to the user's UUID when listed by a preceding
<tt>users</tt> command.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>cp</tt></h3>

<pre>cp [-owner (&lt;uuid> | &lt;%index>)] [-exclude &lt;pattern>]* &lt;pattern>*</pre>

<p>Copy files and folders into the registry as RegistryPackage and
ExtrinsicObject objects, respectively.</p>

<p>The "local directory" on the local filesystems from which to copy
files and folders defaults to the current directory from which you
started the admin tool.  You can change the "local directory" at
startup using the <tt>-localdir</tt> parameter, or you can change it
after the admin tool has started using the <tt>lcd</tt> command.  You
can get the absolute path of the current "local directory" using the
<tt>show localdir</tt> command.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>echo</tt></h3>

<pre>echo &lt;string></pre>

<p>Echoes the string to the output.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>help</tt></h3>

<pre>help [&lt;command>]</pre>

<p>Display information about the available commands or a particular command.</p>

<p><tt>help</tt> by itself displays the usage information for all commands.</p>

<p><tt>help</tt> followed by a command name, e.g., <tt> help add</tt>,
displays information about that command.  For commands with
subcommands, e.g., <tt>add</tt>, it displays information about the
subcommands.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>info</tt></h3>

<p>Not implemented.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>lcd</tt></h3>

<pre>lcd [&lt;filename>]</pre>

<p>Change the current "local directory" on the local filesystems.</p>

<div>
<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>Change the "local directory" to the <tt>/usr/share</tt> directory:</p>

<pre>lcd /usr/share</pre>

<p>Change the "local directory" to your default directory on the local
filesystems:</p>

<pre>lcd</pre>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>ls</tt></h3>

<pre>ls [(&lt;pattern> | &lt;uuid>)+]</pre>

<p>List the objects in the current RegistryPackage or, when
<i>pattern</i> or <i>uuid</i> is provided, list the objects in the
current RegistryPackage whose name (in the current locale) match
<i>pattern</i> or <i>uuid</i>.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>pwd</tt></h3>

<pre>pwd</pre>

<p>Display the path (or paths) to the current RegistryPackage using
the best-matching names for the current locale.  Also displays the
current locale.</p>

<div>
<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>admin> <b>pwd</b>
(en_US) /registry/userData</pre>


</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>quit</tt></h3>

<pre>quit</pre>

<p>Exit the admin shell tool.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>rm</tt></h3>

<pre>rm [-d] [-r] (&lt;pattern> | &lt;uuid>)+</pre>

<p>Remove the member objects of the current RegistryPackage whose name
(in the current locale) match the patterns specified by a
<i>pattern</i> or <i>uuid</i>.</p>

<p>When a matching registry object is a member of multiple
RegistryPackages, this command just removes the Association between
the current RegistryPackage and the object.  The object is removed
from the registry only when removing the Association leaves it with no
other Association with any other registry object.</p>

<p>When a matching member object is itself a RegistryPackage that
contains other objects, neither the object nor the Association between
the current RegistryPackage and the member RegistryPackage are removed
unless either the <tt>-r</tt> or <tt>-d</tt> argument is provided.</p>

<p>When the <tt>-r</tt> argument is provided, the specified
RegistryPackage object and all its descendant objects are removed
(except when an object has other associations).</p>

<p>When the <tt>-d</tt> argument is provided, the Association between
the current RegistryPackage and the specified RegistryPackage is
removed; the RegistryPackage is removed only if its only remaining
associations are to its member objects.  Member objects of the
now-removed RegistryPackage that are not anchored by being the target
of other HasMember associations are now accessible as members of the
root of the registry.</p>

<p>When both both <tt>-d</tt> and <tt>-r</tt> are provided, the
<tt>-d</tt> is applied recursively, so all objects that would be
selected by <tt>-r</tt> (and their associations) are removed whether
or not they have other associations.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>select</tt></h3>

<pre>select [&lt;SQL>]</pre>

<p>Selects and lists the objects specified by evaluating the entire
command as an SQL query.  When the command is only <tt>select</tt>,
lists the objects, if any, selected by a preceding <tt>select</tt>
command.</p> </p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>set</tt></h3>

<pre>set &lt;property> &lt;value></pre>

<p>Sets the value of a property of the admin tool shell.</p>

<p>The properties supported by <tt>set</tt> are:</p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>set debug (true | on | yes | false | off | no)</tt></dt>

<dd>Enables or disables output of debugging messages.</dd>

<dt><tt>set editor &lt;string></tt></dt>

<dd>Sets the command to use when the admin tool launches an
interactive editor.  The default value on Unix and Linux is
<tt>/bin/vi</tt>, and on Windows is <tt>notepad.exe</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>set verbose (true | on | yes | false | off | no)</tt></dt>

<dd>Enables or disables output of more verbose messages when executing
commands.</dd>

</dl>
</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>show</tt></h3>
